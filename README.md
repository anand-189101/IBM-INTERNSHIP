## üí° Project: Power System Fault Detection and Classification

### Problem Statement

Design a **machine learning model** to detect and classify different types of faults in a **power distribution system**.
Using **electrical measurement data** (e.g., voltage and current phasors), the model should distinguish between **normal operating conditions** and various **fault conditions** (line-to-ground, line-to-line, three-phase faults).

‚ö° *Objective*: Enable **rapid and accurate fault identification**, crucial for maintaining **power grid stability and reliability**.

---

### Solution Overview

An **end-to-end ML solution** was developed for **Power System Fault Detection and Classification**.

* The system used the **Kaggle dataset**: [Power System Faults Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/power-system-faults-dataset).
* A **trained ML model** was developed using **IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI**.
* The final model was **deployed as a REST API Web Service** on **IBM Cloud** for real-time fault classification.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**

   * Uploaded dataset from Kaggle into IBM Cloud Project.

2. **Automated Model Building**

   * Configured an **AutoAI experiment** in Watsonx.ai for automated preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and optimization.

3. **Model Selection**

   * AutoAI ranked multiple classification algorithms.
   * **Batched Tree Ensemble Classifier** achieved the best accuracy.

4. **Deployment**

   * Saved the top-performing pipeline as a **model asset**.
   * Deployed it as an **Online Web Service (REST API)** using IBM Watsonx.ai Deployment Space.

5. **Testing**

   * API endpoint successfully tested with sample data to validate real-time classification performance.

---

## üìä Results

* The deployed model achieved **high classification accuracy**.
* Demonstrated the effectiveness of **AutoAI for rapid ML model development & deployment**.
* Project successfully met all requirements for the **final evaluation & submission**.
